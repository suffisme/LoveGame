**Enter Your names and the person's name you want to check your percentage with.**

### Algorithm : 
```
Suppose U entered.
Salman
Katrina

Then it will use two strings

str1=Salman Loves Katrina
str2=Katrina Loves Salman

again
for str1

it would make a number
where it would see for occurrence of each character
in 
"Salman Loves Katrina"

242121111111
Salmnovektri

these are.occurencd of each alphabet (here name is case insensitive)
and if one character is used it is not counted again

242121111111

it would add
like
num[i]=num[i]+num[length-i]

it would give 353232

it would go repeatedly 
till one digit number is obtained

585
108
90
9
num1=9

and the same will be done to 
"Katrina Loves Salman"

141112211121
262224
684
108
90
9

num2=9
(co incidence)

now it will generate
num=10*num1+num2

i.e. 99%
```

#### However later if percentage is less than 88, it is normalised
